# Medicare Application: A Web-Based Healthcare Management Prototype
This repository contains the source code for a web-based healthcare application prototype, developed as part of my internship at SRM Technologies. The goal of this project was to design and build a centralized platform to help users manage their medical needs, from medication schedules to doctor's appointments.

## âœ¨ Key Features (Proof-of-Concept)
This prototype was designed to explore the following functionalities:

* Medicine Reminders: A system to schedule and receive reminders for medication.

* Disease & Medicine Lookup: A feature to identify information about diseases and corresponding medications from a predefined list.

* Appointment Scheduling: An interface for users to create and manage appointments with doctors.

* User-Friendly Interface: A clean and accessible front-end for easy navigation.

## STATUS
This project is a functional prototype and is not fully developed. It served as a valuable learning experience in front-end web development, user interface design, and handling user data. The core features were partially implemented as a proof-of-concept.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
